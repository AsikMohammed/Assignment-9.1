1. Why MapReduce program is needed in Pig Programming?
    * Pig is an abstraction over MapReduce. In other words, all Pig scripts internally are converted into Map and Reduce tasks to get the task done. 
So Map reduce is the layer on top of which Pig is built. Moreover Map reduce is the means by which Hadoop can communicate with HDFS. 
    * Pig’s programming language referred to as Pig Latin is a coding approach that provides high degree of abstraction for MapReduce 
programming but is a procedural code not declarative. This is why MapReduce program is needed in Pig Programming.

2. Advantages of Pig Latin over Map Reduce:
    * Decrease in development time. This is the biggest advantage especially considering vanilla map-reduce jobs' complexity, time-spent 
and maintenance of the programs.
    * Coding is Highly reduced(number of lines of code is  1/20th  of that required in Map reduce) for example.
    * Pig Latin provides all of the standard data-processing operations, such as join, filter,group by, order by, union, etc.
    * Procedural, not declarative unlike SQL, so easier to follow the commands and provides better expressiveness in the transformation of 
data every step. 
    * Pig provides high-level language that can be used by:
        • Data Analysts
        • Data Scientists

3. What is pig engine and what is its importance?
    It acts as Interpreter between pig latin script and map reduce jobs.It creates environment to execute Pig scripts into series of map 
reduce job in parallel manner.

4. What are the modes of Pig execution?
    There are 2 modes of pig execution
    a. Local Mode
    b. Map Reduce Mode
Local Mode:
    * In this mode, all the files are installed and run from your local host and local file system.
    * This can be started by pig –x local
MapReduce Mode:
    * MapReduce mode is where we load or process the data that exists in the Hadoop File System (HDFS) using Apache Pig
    * This can be started by pig –x mapreduce or by just Pig as Map reduce mode is the default mode

5. What is grunt shell in Pig?
    * Grunt shell is an interactive shell for running Pig Commands.
    * It is used when script is not provided
    * It has line editing facilities like other command line application
    * It also  has a completion mechanism like eclipse which can be done by using TAB KEY
      Eg:grunt > m=foreach a ge
      And if we press the tab key grunt > m=foreach a generate will automatically completed
      
 6. Features Of Pig Latin:
    * Pig Latin is a dataflow language. Each processing step results in a new data set, or relation.
    * Apache Pig is a high-level procedural language for querying large semi-structured datasets using Hadoop and the MapReduce Platform
    * Pig provides an engine for executing data flows in parallel on Hadoop. It includes a language, Pig Latin, for expressing these data flows. 
    * Pig Latin includes operators for many of the traditional data operations (join, sort, filter, etc.), as well as the ability for 
users to develop their own functions for reading, processing, and writing data. 
    * Pig runs on Hadoop. It makes use of both the Hadoop Distributed File System, HDFS, and Hadoop’s processing system, MapReduce.
    * Pig simplifies the use of Hadoop by allowing SQL-like queries to a distributed dataset. 
 
 7. Is Pig latin commands case sensitive? 
    * Pig Latin is not case sensitive language.
    * Only the relation names and the file name should be case sensitive.
 
 8. What is a data flow language?
    This type of programming language models a program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing 
dataflow principles and architecture. This different than that of the sequential execution the data. In contrast, dataflow programming 
emphasizes the movement of data and models programs as a series of connections.
